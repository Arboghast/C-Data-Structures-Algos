//Recurrance Relations
    //used to determine runtimes of recursive algorithms

    //4 methods for solving recurrance relationship: 
    //  1) Back substitution
    //  2) Proof By Induction
    //  3) Masters Theorem
    //  4) Recursion tree

    //T(0) = Time to solve problem of size 0
    //T(n) = Time to solve problem of size n

    //Examples of recurrance relations: 
        // T( n ) = T(n -1) + 1, T( 0 ) = 1
        // F( n ) = F(n -1) + F(n-2) , F(1) =1 , F(0) = 1 Fibbanocci Sequence
